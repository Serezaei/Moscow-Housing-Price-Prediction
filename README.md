# Moscow-Housing-Price-Prediction

This project is about trying to train a model on housing sataset of moscow.

This data set has attriburtes such as number of rooms, area, distance to nearest metro station and etc..

I trained the model using XGBoost and acheived an R2 test score of 0.8 and train score of 0.98. As a result the model is quite accurate.
